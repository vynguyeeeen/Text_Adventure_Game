### Game Summary: 
The following game, titled ‘Dare to Dream’ (D2D) turns Walt Disney's infamous quote into existence: “if you can dream it, you can do it”. The game follows a brand new cryosleep program that will help make anyone’s wildest, supposedly unreachable, dreams come true. 

Let’s say yours was to travel to the legendary lost empire of Atlantis. D2D will get you there. All it takes is your imagination, occasional logic and the ability  to successfully complete 4 rounds: 

    ROUND 1: Confirm interests in participating
    ROUND 2: Recruit a teammate

 Good luck. Good night. And don’t let the bed bug bite
